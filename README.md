A car pooling application focused towards part-time workers and their work commutes.

Standing at the end of it now, like Frodo did at the top of Mount Doom after throwing the ring , I have a notch of regret at the back
of my throat. The idea behind this hand-in was to push my personal project into its' implementation phase, combining both personal affairs and 
school work. Ultimately, like Frodo, I threw away most of the cruicial features, that were dragging me down the mountain, greatly
underestimating the time I was given. Unfortunately no eagles will come for me.

The initial concept was overambitious. The app was supposed to localize every user, and when the time of the ride came, 
every person that was part of the ride, was going to see the location of the driver, prior to his arival.

I spent quite some time designing a rating system, just to throw it away at the end of it. I swear I was doubting myself at a point,
almost scrapping the whole thing and just making a funny app like the rating app from that Black Mirror episode everybody has watched.

My Magnum Opus of a regret is how I fail to adress my in-app resources. No local resources, hardcoded strings and colours,
not even a simple Firebase Database.

Another name to the wall of honor (or the wall of shame) is the preplanned account system. It was going to use google accounts for initial
account details but features such as edit and change photo were going to persist.

As a self-proclaimed GUI proffesional artist, I usually take pride in my simplistic GUI. The irony kicks in when the GUI is simple
just because the app is. Yes I do pull up some tricks, but most of theme are from external libraries.

I have encountered many parties of orcs and Bowsers on the way, memory leakage being a minor one of them.

I just needed to releive my emotions after mentioning what I mentioned, we do not speak of its' name for obvious reasons.

But its not as Grim as I did my best to portray it (Or atleast I hope it isn't).
I am going to pull up an Eminem on you and tell you despite everything bad about it, why I think the outcome is great.

-I learned how to manage the fragment stack, ultimately finishing my app with a single intent.
-I eliminated my stigma towards sketchy files like Manifest and Gradle.
-I learned how to implement Google API (Curse you Place Picker API).
-I got to play with different UI components.
-I became more confident transfering information through bundles.
-I finally understood how RecyclerViews work and can customize them the way I want.

Standing at the top of Mount Doom, probably having an arrow in my butt, looking down at Mordor I can clearly see the path I have taken. The whole process made me realize that
doing all the course exercises wasn't nearly enough to make me a decent Android Developer. The hand-in mixed all those ingredients together
giving me a proper welcoming experience into the Android world. I had to team up with the lovely StackOverflow community and fight my way
to the top.
